# Configuration

The plugin accepts the following options:

- `path`: Your application build path(output->path), for generate the local html file.

- `createLocal`: Generate local file. `boolean` Defaults to `false`.

- `aliOSS`: aliOSS options.

  region: '<Your region>'

  accessKeyId: '<Your AccessKeyId>'

  accessKeySecret: '<Your AccessKeySecret>'

  bucket: 'Your bucket name'

  fileDir: 'file path on alioss'

- `upload`: Your own callback function, accept two parameters:

  @param filename: include the build path, for example `static/js/main.js`
  @param source: the file source

  @return  true/false, true is upload success, on the contrary is upload failed

  ## Notice

  - If you use aliOSS, you can configure `aliOSS`, also you can use `upload` callback, in the callback function, you can write you own code implementation.
  - `publicPath` in webpack should be your cdn path, the compiled file will be replaced with this path.
